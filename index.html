    <p>Wilt Chamberlain's is a basketball icon,his sheer dominance and the numerous records he shattered make him omnipresent in the basketball recordbooks. Known as "The Stilt," or "The Record Book," Chamberlain completely revolutionized the sport as a whole.Wilt  stood at an astounding 7 feet 1 inch tall, and was almost "too athletic" for the size he was. The way he would move around the court was completely unheard of for someone his size. His most famous achievment, and the one that is least likely to be broken, is his one hundred point game on March 2, 1962. There are no video broadcasts of this game, which have caused many to just simply deny that he scored that many points. On top of those hundred points, Wilt stacked on 55 rebounds. An unfair number. Another record he holds is the highest points per game average for a single season at 50.4 points. For context, very few players in today's game average more than 25, and ecen fewer get to 30. Wilt had over 30 points per game for seven consecutive seasons. Additionally, Chamberlain posted 118 50-point games and 32 60-point games, both of which are NBA records. He also somehow managed to lead the league in assists in the 1967-68 season. </p>
